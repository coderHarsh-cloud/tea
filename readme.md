HOW TO MAKE A TEA
first we take our saucer pan and then pour half cup of water in it.
then we start heating the water and add  tealeaves and sugar as per wish.
then as the water starts boiling we add a cup of milk to it.
then if we want we could add some ginger aur tulsi to it but it is optional.
finally as the tea starts boiling we could filter it using a sieve or tea filter.
serve and enjoy!!!.
